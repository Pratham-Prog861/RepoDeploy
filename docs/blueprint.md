# **App Name**: RepoDeploy

## Core Features:

- Landing Page: Simple landing page with a clear explanation of the service and a 'Get Started' button.
- GitHub Repo Input: A field where the user can paste their GitHub repository URL.
- Repository Cloning: Clone the user-provided GitHub repository.
- Automatic Build: Automatically detect the project type (HTML/CSS/JS, React, etc.) and build the frontend project. If the system doesn't find an explicit build command (like 'npm run build') it uses a tool to intelligently look for 'index.html'.
- Static Hosting: Host the built static files.
- Unique Live URL: Provide a unique live URL (e.g., randomstring.myapp.com) to access the deployed project.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #5DADE2 (a versatile, slightly muted blue that evokes trustworthiness and stability)
- Background color: #F8F9FA (very light gray, providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop).
- Accent color: #3498DB (a brighter blue analogous to the primary, offering clear visual distinction)
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, providing a clean and modern look suitable for both headings and body text.
- Simple, outline-style icons to represent key actions and concepts.
- Clean and minimal layout, prioritizing ease of use and clarity.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience (e.g., loading spinners, button hover effects).
